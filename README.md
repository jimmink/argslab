# argslab
Repository for ArGSLab, Arrested and Gelated Structures Laboratory.

The two folders "ArGSLab_Standalone" and "ArGSLab_GUI" each contain a version of ArGSLab. The Standalone version can be used without installation, and users should only change "parameters.m" and run "main.m". The GUI version contains the interface, containing an intuitive access to the same functionalities of the Standalone version. 

This package is intended as freeware. If one uses ArGSLab or part of ArGSLab for any publication, please cite our original work.
